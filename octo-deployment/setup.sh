# OCTO Deployment · Interactive Setup Script
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Generates docker/.env from docker/.env.example with rotated secrets,
# user-chosen domain/IP, and optional TLS / LLM summary toggles. Also
# offers post-deploy smoke test (`--smoke-test`, with `--verify` kept
# as a deprecated alias) and clean uninstall (`--uninstall`)
# subcommands.
#
# Usage:
#   ./setup.sh                        # interactive mode
#   ./setup.sh --non-interactive      # all defaults + auto-detect
#   ./setup.sh --domain octo.example.com --ip 1.2.3.4 --https --summary
#   ./setup.sh --smoke-test           # smoke-test an already-up stack
#   ./setup.sh --verify               # deprecated alias for --smoke-test
#   ./setup.sh --uninstall            # tear down the stack (interactive)

#                 Failures here mean the platform itself is unhealthy (a
#                 container is down, nginx isn't reverse-proxying, or a
#                 host port is firewalled). The operator should look at

#   [user-path] — steps 8-11: WuKongIM /ws upgrade + admin login + presign
#                 issuance + signed PUT. Failures here mean the platform
#                 is up but the end-to-end business contract is broken
#                 (auth wired wrong, MinIO IAM creds desynced, SigV4
#                 signing mismatch). The operator should look at

#               (transient — pollers should keep waiting; `--verify`
#               treats this as a failure).
#     FATAL  →  `Created`, `Exited (…)` (ANY code, including 0 —
#               long-running svcs must never exit), `Restarting (…)`,
#               `Dead`, `Paused`, `Removing`, or missing container row.
#
#   one-shot service (preflight, minio-init):
#     PASS   →  `Exited (0)` (job ran and finished cleanly).
#     WAIT   →  still `Up …` / `Created` (job has not finished yet).

#            still in the cold-boot race window — Compose ordered
#            it after a depends_on gate and has not `Start`-ed it
#            yet); or a one-shot that has not yet finished.

#            end the wait. `Created` likewise flips to `Up` once
#            the gate clears.

# Default wait timeout (seconds) for `compose up -d --wait` and the

# panic-and-recover after mysql warms 25-45s; dependents unblock another

# truly stuck container hang the script forever (the manual-poll
# fallback also escalates `FATAL` rows to immediate fail). Combined

# turns a known-transient flap into a single-pass `--up`. We retry ONLY
# when no service has actually died (hard-failure rows — Restarting /
# Dead / Exited(non-zero) — short-circuit straight to the diagnostic
# dump on the first attempt). To keep the failure narrative readable,

# R7 (YUJ-1020 / GH#40+41): placeholder-aware host selection helper.
#
# The OOTB deployment has TWO independent host knobs that until R7 were
# never reconciled at the system layer (the per-PR fixes in PR#43 / PR#44
# disagreed on which one was authoritative for which path — see the R7
# decision context). This helper makes the system decision explicit and
# the rest of the script reads it.
#
# Rule:
#   - `OCTO_DOMAIN` is a PLACEHOLDER (empty or the literal default
#     `localhost` — operator never put real DNS in front of the VM) →
#     `OCTO_EXTERNAL_IP` is the authoritative host. setup.sh
#     materialises explicit `MINIO_SERVER_URL` / `TS_MINIO_DOWNLOADURL`
#     / `TS_EXTERNAL_BASEURL` overrides pointing at the IP (S1 below),
#     and `--smoke-test` probes the IP (S2 below). The presigned PUT
#     URL the server returns therefore uses the IP and the browser /
#     curl can actually reach it.
#   - `OCTO_DOMAIN` is a REAL domain (anything other than empty /
#     `localhost`) → `OCTO_DOMAIN` is the authoritative host. Compose
#     defaults (`${OCTO_DOMAIN}:${OCTO_HTTP_PORT}`) take effect, the
#     three URL overrides are NOT written into `.env`, and the
#     `--smoke-test` probes the DOMAIN. `OCTO_EXTERNAL_IP` keeps its
#     existing role for internal binding / firewall guidance only.
#
# Historical note (GH#49, 2026-05-18): the placeholder used to be
# `octo.local`, which does not resolve on a fresh Mac install and
# caused IM WebSocket close code 1006. The placeholder is now
# `localhost` everywhere; the rule above is unchanged.
#
# Returns 0 (true) if OCTO_DOMAIN is a placeholder, 1 (false) otherwise.
# Reads strictly from `.env` (via env_get) so the same answer is given
# from --up / --smoke-test / .env-generation paths.

# docker/.env.example) used to trip the placeholder + EXTERNAL_IP guard
# below and materialise MINIO_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:28080 (plus the
# two TS overrides). The browser then loaded the admin page at
# http://localhost:28080 but img src URLs pointed at 127.0.0.1:28080 —
# the CSP `'self'` policy treats these as different origins and blocked
# every inline image, and Set-Cookie under one host wasn't sent under
# the other. Treat loopback IPs (and the empty string, mirroring the
# `-z` arm of is_placeholder_domain) as "same as localhost" so the

Usage: setup.sh [--non-interactive] [--force] [--domain <d>] [--ip <ip>]
                [--https] [--summary] [--up]
       setup.sh --smoke-test (or --verify, deprecated alias)
       setup.sh --uninstall

Generation:
  --non-interactive   Skip prompts; use defaults + auto-detect for anything
                      not provided via flags.
  --force             Overwrite an existing docker/.env without prompting.
  --domain <d>        Set OCTO_DOMAIN (default: localhost).
  --ip <ip>           Set OCTO_EXTERNAL_IP (skip auto-detect).
  --https             HTTPS preparation flag. Prints the manual
                      activation steps. This does NOT fully enable
                      HTTPS — you still need to install certs, edit
                      nginx + docker-compose, and restart manually.
                      See docker/certs/README.md for the full procedure.
  --summary           Enable the optional LLM summary services
                      (COMPOSE_PROFILES=summary).
  --up                START-ONLY subcommand (peer of --smoke-test /
                      --uninstall): requires an existing docker/.env and
                      runs `docker compose up -d --wait --wait-timeout
                      240`, blocking until every long-running service is
                      healthy AND every one-shot init job (preflight /
                      minio-init) exited 0. On a cold-boot soft timeout
                      the wait retries ONCE on the warm mysql / image
                      cache (typically <10s). NEVER regenerates secrets
                      — run `./setup.sh` first to create docker/.env, or
                      pass `--up --force` to explicitly bootstrap +
                      start in one shot (the only path that generates
                      fresh secrets from a `--up` invocation; see
                      `--force` below).
                      On a second-attempt failure: print `compose ps`,
                      list the specific failing service names, and emit
                      one `logs <svc>` hint for each before exit 1. A
                      '.' prints every 5 seconds while waiting so the
                      run is visibly alive on slow hosts (cold MySQL
                      init can take 60-90s). Requires sudo: the Docker
                      daemon socket needs root, and --up chowns
                      docker/.env back to root:root 600 once the stack
                      is healthy so --smoke-test can read it.
  --up --force        EXPLICIT bootstrap + start in one command. Only
                      meaningful when docker/.env is missing: generate
                      all secrets, then start the stack and wait for
                      healthy. Equivalent to running step 1 + step 2
                      back-to-back. Will refuse to overwrite an
                      existing docker/.env on the generation path (the
                      .env-overwrite prompt / non-interactive guard
                      still applies — see `--force` below). This is the
                      ONLY way `--up` is allowed to write secrets;
                      without --force, a missing docker/.env is a fatal
                      error with concrete remediation.

Smoke test / tear-down (work against an already-existing docker/.env):
  --smoke-test        Probe nginx / octo-server / matter / object-store
                      paths end-to-end. Exits non-zero on any failure.
                      Output is grouped into [infra] (steps 1-7) and
                      [user-path] (steps 8-11) so a failure tells you
                      immediately which failure-domain to investigate.
                      Real side-effects: 1 POST (admin login), 1 GET
                      (presign issuance), 1 PUT (1-byte sentinel object
                      left in the MinIO `common` bucket, since the
                      probe issues credentials for type=common). Not a
                      dry-run.
  --verify            Deprecated alias for --smoke-test. Prints a yellow
                      deprecation notice and otherwise runs identically.
                      Kept for at least 2 releases; slated for removal
                      in v2.0+. Prefer --smoke-test in new automation.
  --uninstall         Tear down the stack. Interactively offers three
                      granularity levels (full / data-only / containers-only).

When any of --domain / --ip / --https / --summary is given without
--non-interactive, setup.sh treats the flags as your decisions and runs
non-interactively so the documented one-liner forms (see docker/README.md)
work as written. --up is a start-only subcommand (peer of --smoke-test
/ --uninstall) and never participates in the decision-flag handling.

  #
  # Background: WuKongIM is the chat transport. Before this probe,
  # `--verify` had no way to detect that wukongim had stopped:
  # `(unhealthy)` only fires when the healthcheck has actually run and
  # failed, but a freshly stopped container disappears from the
  # `running` set and (depending on `restart:` policy) never enters
  # `unhealthy` at all. The new fatal-state check in step 1 covers
  # `Exited (1)` / `Restarting` / `Dead`, but a clean `docker stop
  # wukongim` leaves the container as `Exited (0)` and slips past
  # both. So we also probe the user-visible WS surface end-to-end:
  # nginx → wukongim:5200.
  #
  # We send a real WebSocket upgrade request (RFC 6455 §4.1 mandatory
  # headers: `Upgrade: websocket`, `Connection: Upgrade`,
  # `Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13`, base64 `Sec-WebSocket-Key`). Expected
  # responses when WuKongIM is online:
  #   - `101 Switching Protocols`  (full handshake accepted — happy)
  #   - `400 Bad Request`          (WuKongIM is up but rejected our
  #                                 partial handshake — also healthy
  #                                 evidence)
  #   - `426 Upgrade Required`     (some WuKongIM versions return this
  #                                 for non-conforming upgrades)
  # Failure signals:
  #   - `502 / 503 / 504`          (nginx reached, upstream wukongim
  #                                 absent / down)
  #   - `000`                      (connection refused / curl error)
  # Other 4xx/5xx are bucketed as failure too; safer to false-positive
  # on weird WuKongIM upgrades than to false-negative on a stopped

  #     WS_OUT="$(python3 …)"
  # propagates the command-substitution exit status to the assignment;
  # `set -e` then immediately aborts the whole `--verify` run as soon as
  # python3 returns non-zero (i.e. the very case step 5.5 is meant to
  # report). That swallowed every downstream check — the `fail` line, the
  # `((fails++))`, the admin-login probe, the presigned-PUT probe — and
  # left `--verify` exiting 0-ish or aborting silently with no fails-count
  # summary. The `WS_STATUS=$?` line below was effectively dead code.
  # Using `if … then … else WS_STATUS=$? fi` keeps the command substitution
  # inside the "test in an if statement" exemption listed in bash(1) under
  # `set -e`, so the failing python3 is captured (not fatal), `WS_STATUS`
  # is set to the python exit code, and the rest of `--verify` proceeds

#   ./setup.sh                    # step 1: gen .env (interactive, no sudo)
#   sudo ./setup.sh --up          # step 2: start the stack (start-only)
#   sudo ./setup.sh --smoke-test  # step 3: verify
#
# Before R6 the script forced NON_INTERACTIVE=true on --up and then hit
# the "docker/.env already exists" guard a few lines below — fatal in
# the exact workflow our own README documented. Adding --force would
# have regenerated every secret and broken step 1's output. The clean
# fix is to short-circuit here: validate that .env exists, then delegate
# straight to compose_up_and_wait and exit. No prompt, no overwrite, no
# secret regeneration on this code path — ever.

# INCIDENT-2026-05-16-001 follow-up: the interactive preflight may
# `export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=octo-<suffix>` so the rest of THIS shell
# scopes correctly, but that export vanishes the moment the operator
# exits setup.sh. A later `cd docker && docker compose up -d --wait`
# in a fresh shell would then silently fall back to the YAML `name: octo`
# default, mount the `octo_*` volume set, and (because the project name
# now mismatches) a subsequent `setup.sh --uninstall` grep would happily
# scoop up volumes from OTHER `octo-*` stacks on the same host.
#
# Writing the value into `docker/.env` is the documented, Compose-native
# way to make project-name selection durable: Compose auto-loads `.env`
# from its project directory before reading either `name:` or the
# COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME shell env var, so the `up -d` from a vanilla
# shell ends up scoped to the same project this setup chose.
# R8 (YUJ-1002 / Jerry-Xin W1): mirror the `project_name()` precedence
# (shell > docker/.env > "octo") here as well. The previous form
# `${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME:-octo}` ignored the persisted `.env` value
# and so an `./setup.sh --force` rerun from a shell that had NOT
# re-exported COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME overwrote a saved `octo-fz` with
# the default `octo` — quietly re-aliasing the stack onto the shared
# `octo_*` volume set on the next `compose up`. `read_existing_project_name`
# reads the same `.env` file the rest of the script speaks to, so the
# three layers stay in lock-step with the documented `project_name()`
# contract.
# R9 (YUJ-1004 / Jerry-Xin + lml2468 P0-1): the R8 form still re-read
# `.env` here, but by this point the template has already been installed
# over it (line 1186) so the docker/.env-side fallback resolves to the
# template literal `octo` instead of the operator's `octo-fz`. Use the
# `SAVED_PROJECT` snapshot captured *before* the template overwrite (see
# the read-before-overwrite block above) so the shell-export → previously-
# persisted-.env → "octo" precedence stays intact across `--force` reruns.

# S1 (R7 / YUJ-1020 / GH#41): placeholder-aware materialisation of
# MinIO / TS URL overrides.
#
# When the operator uses `--ip <public-IP>` WITHOUT a real `--domain`,
# `OCTO_DOMAIN` stays at its placeholder `localhost` and the compose
# defaults (`http://${OCTO_DOMAIN}:${OCTO_HTTP_PORT}`) end up signing
# presigned PUT URLs against `http://localhost:28080/...`. A remote
# browser sees `localhost` and tries its OWN loopback (not the VM),
# and every image / file message silently breaks at the upload step —
# the same failure mode caught on Coda E2E v12 (GH#41) and on the
# fresh-Mac install reported in GH#49.
#
# When `OCTO_DOMAIN` IS a real domain (anything other than empty /
# `localhost`), the compose defaults already do the right thing and
# rely on DNS — writing IP-based overrides here would break that DNS
# topology (`--domain octo.example.com --ip 1.2.3.4` would have client
# browsers calling the IP instead of the documented domain).
#
# So S1 materialises three lockstep overrides ONLY when all of:
#   (1) OCTO_DOMAIN is placeholder (empty or `localhost`), AND
#   (2) OCTO_EXTERNAL_IP is set (operator gave us something concrete), AND
#   (3) OCTO_EXTERNAL_IP is NOT a loopback (`127.0.0.1` / `::1` / `localhost`
#       / empty) — GH#54: when the IP is loopback it is same-origin with
#       the `localhost` placeholder, so materialising the overrides is a
#       no-op for reachability AND actively breaks CSP / cookies because
#       the browser then loads the page at one of {localhost, 127.0.0.1}
#       and the img src URLs at the other. Skip the block and let the
#       compose defaults (`http://${OCTO_DOMAIN}:${OCTO_HTTP_PORT}` =
#       `http://localhost:28080`) take over so everything stays on a
#       single origin.
# All three URLs must agree (SigV4 rejects every PUT with `403
# SignatureDoesNotMatch` if MINIO_SERVER_URL and TS_MINIO_DOWNLOADURL
# disagree on host:port), so they are written as a single block.
# Reads/imports stay literal — Compose interpolates `.env` once into
