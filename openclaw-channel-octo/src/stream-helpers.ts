/**
 * Stream a Web ReadableStream to a file path with a strict byte cap.
 *
 * - Counts every chunk from `body` toward `maxBytes`. The first chunk that
 *   pushes the running total past `maxBytes` aborts the read, cancels the
 *   upstream reader, destroys the write stream, unlinks the partial temp
 *   file, and throws `File too large (exceeds max <maxBytes> bytes)`.
 * - Honours backpressure: if `ws.write` returns false the loop awaits
 *   `drain`, racing it against any error event on the write stream so a
 *   mid-write disk-full / EIO surfaces promptly instead of hanging.
 * - On any error path (cap exceeded, write error, drain race, reader
 *   error) the upstream fetch body reader is cancelled so undici can
 *   release the socket immediately rather than at GC time.
 *
 * **Caller contract:**
 * - Caller opens the fetch and passes its `body` (a Web ReadableStream).
 *   We do NOT take a `Response` because callers may want to read other
 *   parts of it (headers etc.) before handing the body off.
 * - Caller chooses `destPath`. We open the write stream ourselves so the
 *   error/destroy/unlink lifecycle is contained in one place.
 * - On success, the temp file at `destPath` is the caller's to use; we
 *   do NOT unlink on success. Caller's `finally` block handles the
 *   eventual cleanup.
 * - On error, we unlink the partial temp file before re-throwing so the
 *   caller doesn't have to special-case partial-write cleanup.
