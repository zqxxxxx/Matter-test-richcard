/**
 * Strip any of the known channel namespace prefixes (`octo:`, `channel:`,

 * **recursively** — stacked prefixes such as `"octo:group:grp1"` or
 * `"channel:octo:grp1"` are stripped down to `"grp1"` in one call.
 * Fully idempotent for any input.
 *
 * Why three prefixes: the OpenClaw runtime passes channel ids through several
 * layers (gateway, plugin SDK, agent tool context) and different layers
 * historically attach different namespace prefixes. Comparisons between
 * channel ids therefore need a single normalization step that strips
 * whichever prefix is present, so two callers do not silently miscompare
 * `"octo:grp1"` against `"grp1"` or `"channel:grp1"` against `"group:grp1"`.
 *
 * Recursive vs. the old chained-replace site: the previous threadId-parsing
 * site at src/actions.ts ran `replace(/^octo:/)` then `replace(/^group:/)`
 * then `replace(/^channel:/)`, which collapsed some stacked forms (e.g.
 * `"octo:group:topicA"` → `"topicA"`) but NOT all (e.g.
 * `"channel:octo:grp1"` → `"octo:grp1"`, because only the final
 * `channel:` replace stripped the outer layer and the chain never re-ran
 * `octo:` against the now-exposed inner prefix). The recursive helper is
 * **intentionally broader** than the old chain: it canonicalizes any order
 * of stacked runtime prefixes. Net effect is strictly safer for downstream
 * comparisons and matches the helper's "all channel prefixes" name.
 *
 * Note: this is a prefix-strip, not a prefix-rewrite. `normalizeOutboundChannelPrefix`
 * in src/actions.ts is a different operation that canonicalises outbound
 * channel-group targets to a single leading `group:` (and shares this
 * recursive collapse internally to handle stacked outbound forms safely).
