## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Please report security issues by emailing the maintainers directly. Include:

1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Potential impact
4. Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix or mitigation plan within 7 days.

## Scope

This policy covers:
- Authentication bypass or token forgery
- Authorization flaws (cross-space data access)
- SQL injection or data exposure
- Denial of service via resource exhaustion
- Sensitive data in logs or error responses

## Token Handling

A bot token never appears on the command line. `octo-cli auth login` reads it from a
hidden, asterisk-masked terminal prompt, from stdin (`--with-token`), or from a
file (`--token-file`) — so it is never written to argv, shell history, or an
agent transcript.

Wherever a token surfaces in output (`auth status`, `config show`, `--dry-run`
Authorization header) it is masked. For a recognized kind the masking reveals
the prefix, two leading body chars, a fixed `***`, and the last four chars (so
two tokens are distinguishable without exposing the secret, and the middle is
fixed-width so token length is not leaked):

| Token | Displayed as |
|---|---|
| `app_<long body>` | `app_ab***5678` |
| `bf_<long body>` | `bf_so***hing` |
| `app_`/`bf_` with a short body | `app_***` / `bf_***` |
| Unrecognized prefix | `***` (reveal nothing) |
| Empty | `null` |

## Credential Storage

`octo-cli auth login` stores tokens encrypted on disk under `~/.octo-cli` (override
with `OCTO_CONFIG_DIR`):

- **`credentials.enc`** (0600) — tokens, AES-256-GCM with a random per-message
  nonce. **`config.json`** (non-secret profile metadata) and **`cred.salt`**
  (0600) live alongside; the directory is 0700.
- The encryption key is `SHA256(machineID ‖ salt)`. The machine id is read per
  OS (`/etc/machine-id` on Linux, `IOPlatformUUID` on macOS, `MachineGuid` on
  Windows; platforms without one fall back to salt-only). It is **not a secret**
  — the binding means a copied/synced/backed-up `~/.octo-cli` cannot be
  decrypted on a *different* machine, not that an attacker who has the file
  cannot eventually decrypt it given the same host.

**Trust boundary: the OS user account.** Any process running as the same user
can run `octo-cli` and therefore decrypt the store; the encryption defends against
off-machine leakage (accidental commit, backup, cloud sync), not a co-resident
process. Isolate mutually-distrusting bots with separate OS users or separate
`OCTO_CONFIG_DIR` values. The CLI's anti-misuse guards (ambiguous selection is a
hard error, `--bot-id` assertion, `identity` echoed on every response) prevent
*accidental* wrong-identity use, not a malicious same-user process.
