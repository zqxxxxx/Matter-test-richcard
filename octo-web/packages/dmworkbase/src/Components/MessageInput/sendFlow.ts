/**
 * Send-flow orchestration helper (octo-web#227, Jerry-Xin P1).
 *
 * Background — two data-loss bugs this guards against:
 *
 * 1. (round 1) `MessageInput.send()` used to call `props.onSend(...)` (typed
 *    `=> void`, never awaited) and then, in the *same synchronous frame*,
 *    unconditionally cleared the editor, deleted pasted-image `File` refs,
 *    revoked preview URLs and cleared the top-attachment area. For the mixed
 *    text+image RichText path `onSend` is async and only fails after an upload,
 *    so the compose state was destroyed before the failure was known — one
 *    failed upload wiped the whole draft with nothing to retry.
 *    Fix: make the contract awaitable and clean up ONLY after a successful send.
 *
 * 2. (round 2 — this file's reason for being snapshot-aware) Once the send was
 *    awaited, the editor stayed editable during the wait. `Conversation.onSend`
 *    can take seconds (image upload + message ack). If the user finished one
 *    message and started typing the next while the first was still pending, the
 *    successful completion of the *older* send cleared the *current* (newer)
 *    editor document and top-attachment list — wiping the new draft. Pure text
 *    is affected too, because the callback now awaits `sendTextAndWaitAck`.
 *    Fix: cleanup is snapshot-aware. The editor is only cleared if it still
 *    holds exactly the content that was sent (`isEditorUnchanged`); otherwise
 *    the user's newer draft is left untouched. Top attachments are removed by
 *    the specific ids that were consumed, never with a blanket reset, so items
 *    queued during the wait survive.
 *    Residual follow-up: when the editor changed mid-flight we leave the live
 *    doc untouched, so the already-sent snapshot blocks stay alongside the new
 *    draft and could be re-sent on the next send (duplicate). Accepted over the
 *    worse "draft wiped" failure; a precise per-range removal is deferred — see
 *    the `!isEditorUnchanged()` branch below.
 *
 * `onSend` return-value contract (back-compatible):
 *   - `undefined` / `void` → success: editor consumed, all consumed top
 *     attachments cleared (legacy void-returning callers keep working);
 *   - `true`               → success: same as void;
 *   - `false`              → failure / nothing sent: PRESERVE everything so the
 *     user can retry;
 *   - `{ editorConsumed, consumedTopIds }` → partial result. Lets a caller say
 *     "the editor compose failed and must be preserved, but these top
 *     attachments were already sent — drop just those so a retry does not
 *     duplicate them" (octo-web#227 non-blocking note by Jerry-Xin);
 *   - throws               → treated as failure → preserve everything.
